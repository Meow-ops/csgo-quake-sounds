### FAQ

* Will I get banned for using this ?

No.

* Does it work in matchmaking ? On faceit ?

Yes.

* Can I add my own sounds ?

Yes. Feel free to remove the ones you don't like, too.

* What's this networking stuff ?

If you play with friends, sounds will be shared when spectating, or on certain rare events.

This allows everyone to use their own custom sounds, without hearing different sounds.
